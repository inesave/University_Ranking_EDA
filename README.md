## What is this EDA about?

Deciding where to initiate higher education is a strategic decision in a person’s life. It will have an impact for the extent of their studies or longer.  To make an informed decision there are multiple factors to be considered such as the university’s prestige or the country’s quality of life. In this Exploratory Data Analysis I intend to discover the institution where an international student should start their my studies considering these factors.

In order to do so, I gather information from 3 main datasets to calculate two indexes:
1. University quality index: 
Takes into account (1) Number of international Students. The higher the number of international students, the higher the index. 
(2) Research output. The higher the reesearch output, the higher the index. (3) Number of students assigned per faculty. The lower the number, the higher the index. There are more teachers per student, which increases the attention given to each student. (4) Size of the university in terms of area. The higher the number, the higher the index.
2. Life quality index: 
Factors in (1) Stability: Indicator of political and economic stability based on Worldwide Governance Indicators. (2) Rights: Legal system and civil rights indicator based on a government’s law implementation and compliance (measured by the "rule of law"), regulatory quality and level of corruption. (3) Health: Indicator based on the average life expectancy of a country. (4) Safety: Takes into account the homicide rate of a country, displaced persons, violent crimes and wars. (5) Climate: To create the index, a maximum daily temperature of 25 °C at 55 percent humidity was considered the ideal environment. (6) Costs: Combines the national cost of living, the average annual income, the maximum corporate and income tax rates and the World Bank's "Ease of Doing Business Index". (7) Popularity: This index considers the general migration rate and the number of foreign tourists.
