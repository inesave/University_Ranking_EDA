## What is this EDA about?

Deciding where to initiate higher education is a strategic decision in a person’s life. It will have an impact for the extent of their studies or longer.  To make an informed decision there are multiple factors to be considered such as the university’s prestige or the country’s quality of life. In this Exploratory Data Analysis I intend to discover the institution where I should have started my studies, considering the different factors that influence my decision.
